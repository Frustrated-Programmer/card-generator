# Installing
If you would like to run this you need to follow these commands (assuming you have node.js):
`npm install` & `npm start build`.

Afterwords you should get the `browsered.js` file, `node_modules` folder, and a `package-lock.json` file. If you're missing any, start an issue and let me know. You need at minimum the `browsered.js` and `node_modules` files.
