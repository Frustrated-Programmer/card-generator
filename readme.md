# Card Generator
###### Found at http://frustratedprogrammer.com/card-generator/
### Note: This was designed in the Chrome's browser. Visual glitches **will** be in other browsers. I haven't had time to fix them yet.
###### Currently set up for Dungeon's and Dragon's 5e.
The card generator is split into 5 parts, that each do different things, you can go to previous steps, but cannot go ahead until you complete the current step.


### Step 1
###### Choose cards
On this page you are greeted by 9 different cards, 8 of them are classes that you can choose to get the spells for that class specifically.<br>
The last card allows you to create a filter to select specific cards to generate.
### Step 2
###### Verify Cards and remove cards you don't want.
This step is the least complex and useful but needed nonetheless. On this step you are shown ***every*** spell it's going to generate, so you can go through the list and check whether you have all the spells you need.

### Step 3
###### Choose Front/Back side of cards
On this page you are need to select what you want the cards to look like, you can choose from a list of pre-generated spells OR upload custom images for the front or back.
### Step 3.5
###### Edit custom card
This page ***only*** get's shown if the user decides to upload a custom FRONT of a card. Here they align text templates up with their image to create a card template. Each text template gets replaced with text corresponding with the spell it's generating.


### Step 4
###### Generate cards
This page is the least important, but without a loading screen user's may thing the system crashed. So this is what they see while it's generating each card.

### Step 5
###### Show cards
This page is where the user's see a PDF of all their cards front and backs aligned. The user can then download their PDF or just print them from there.
