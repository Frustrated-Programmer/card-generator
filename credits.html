    This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:

    <p>-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
    SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007<br>
        -----------------------------------------------------------</p>
    
    PREAMBLE
    <p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
    development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
    efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
    open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
        with others.</p>
    
    <p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
    redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
    fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
    redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
    names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
    however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
    requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
        to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
    
    DEFINITIONS
    <p>"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright

    copyright statement(s).

    new environment.
    
    "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
    writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.</p>
    
    PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

    binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
    
    3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font

    TERMINATION

        not met.</p>
